We offer design and fabrication services for early-stage hardware, precision parts, and one-off prototypes.

Our in-house tools include a CNC mill, lathe, sandblaster, and multiple 3D printers—ideal for iterative development and small-batch production.

#### What We Offer

- **CAD + CAM for a Specific Part**  
  Send us a rough sketch or spec—we’ll model the part, generate toolpaths, and machine it in-house.  

- **Small Prototyping Runs**  
  Need 2–10 units for fit checks, field testing, or investor demos? We can help.

- **.STEP File Evaluation**  
  Already have a part designed? We can perform a test CAM pass and rough cut to evaluate tolerances, material behavior, and fit before moving forward.

#### Supported Materials

- Aluminum (6061, 7075)  
- 4140 and A2 tool steel (small parts only)  
- Delrin / Acetal  
- Wood (hardwood or plywood prototypes)

#### Pricing Guidance

All projects are quoted individually, but for reference:

- **Simple one-off parts:** $250–$600  
- **Custom billet parts or complex geometry:** $800–$2,000  
- **Prototyping runs (5–10 units):** $1,200 and up  

Pricing depends on material, complexity, fixturing, toolpathing effort, and required tolerances. We’re competitive with industry standards and offer clear up-front estimates.
