### FAQ

**Who owns the site and domain?**
You do. We register the domain on your behalf and transfer full control to you. Likewise, the GitHub organization will be yours—we’ll just request temporary access to build and deploy your site.

**Can we remove your access later?**
Yes. Once everything is live, you can remove us at any time. Or, if you’d prefer ongoing support and updates, we offer an annual support retainer.

**Will I need to manage the codebase?**
No. Your site is generated directly from content you provide in plain text (Markdown), meaning you don’t have to deal with code artifacts or technical complexity.

**How do I update the site?**
Just send us new Markdown content—or use the optional CMS—and we’ll take care of the rest. Updates can be deployed automatically, without any manual code edits.

**Is hosting included?**
We deploy your site to a globally distributed CDN with near-zero hosting cost. No need for traditional web hosting or server management.
