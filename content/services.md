### CNC machining services {#cnc}

We run one 4-axis mill and one CNC lathe focused on prototypes and short-run parts. Materials we regularly keep on hand include 6061, 7075, stainless, tool steel, Delrin, and other engineering plastics. Every job ships with simple measurement notes so you know what we checked.

---

### Mechatronics &amp; embedded support {#mecha}

Need firmware tweaks, harnesses, or test rigs alongside the machined parts? We can help with quick firmware flashes, data capture, and bench fixtures so you aren’t chasing separate vendors.

---

### Tooling, fixtures, and 3D printing

We keep two engineering-grade printers online for workholding, assembly aids, and lightweight fixtures. When a machined plate or carbon-filled print will save time on the next build, we include it.

---

### Engagement options

- **Project-based machining:** Send CAD or prints; we’ll program, machine, inspect, and ship.
- **Hands-on partner:** Keep us in the loop on firmware and test, and we’ll jump on calls or Slack as work progresses.
- **Sustaining support:** Hold recurring slots on the mill or lathe for ongoing hardware programs.
