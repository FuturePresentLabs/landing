## Instant Quoting: From CAD to Price in Hours, Not Days

<img src="/images/instant-quote/hero-instant-quote.png" alt="Modern manufacturing facility with instant digital quoting" class="hero-image" style="width: 100%; max-width: min(900px, 95vw); height: auto; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px;">

**Stop waiting days for manufacturing quotes.** At Future Present Labs, we've built a quoting system that gives you transparent pricing fast—so you can make decisions and move forward with confidence.

Whether you need a single prototype or a small production run, our instant quoting process gets you from CAD file to confirmed price quickly, with no hidden fees or surprises.

## The Problem with Traditional Manufacturing Quotes

If you've worked with traditional machine shops, you know the drill:

1. **Email your files** and wait...
2. **Follow up** a day later when you haven't heard back
3. **Answer clarifying questions** about tolerances, materials, quantities
4. **Wait some more** while they manually calculate
5. **Receive an opaque quote** with unclear line items
6. **Start over** when the price doesn't match your budget

**Total time: 3-7 days.** That's a week of project delay before you even start production.

## Our Instant Quoting Process

<img src="/images/instant-quote/quote-process.png" alt="Streamlined quoting process from upload to quote" class="section-image" style="width: 100%; max-width: min(700px, 95vw); height: auto; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px;">

We've streamlined the process to get you answers fast:

### 1. Upload Your Files

Send us your CAD files via our [contact form](/contact/), email, or direct file transfer. We accept:

- **STEP** (.step, .stp) — Preferred for CNC machining
- **STL** (.stl) — For 3D printing
- **Parasolid** (.x_t, .x_b) — For complex geometry
- **SolidWorks** (.sldprt, .sldasm) — Native format support
- **Fusion 360** — Direct export compatibility
- **AutoCAD DXF** — For 2D waterjet/laser cutting

Don't have CAD files? Send us a sketch, photo, or detailed description. Our engineers can help translate your concept into manufacturable geometry.

### 2. Automated Design Analysis

Our systems automatically analyze your files for:

- **Manufacturability** — Can this be made with standard processes?
- **Material suggestions** — What alloys or plastics fit your needs?
- **Tolerances** — Are your specifications realistic and cost-effective?
- **Setup complexity** — How many operations are required?
- **Risk factors** — Thin walls, deep pockets, tight tolerances

This automated DFM (Design for Manufacturing) check happens within minutes, not days.

### 3. Transparent Pricing

Receive a detailed quote that breaks down:

- **Material costs** — Based on real-time pricing
- **Machine time** — Accurate hour estimates
- **Setup fees** — One-time per-batch costs
- **Post-processing** — Finishing, coating, assembly
- **Shipping** — Options from economy to overnight

**No hidden fees. No surprises.** What you see is what you pay.

### 4. Human Review (When Needed)

For complex parts or unusual requirements, a human engineer reviews the automated quote to ensure accuracy. This hybrid approach gives you speed without sacrificing precision.

**Most quotes are returned within 2-4 hours during business hours.** Complex assemblies may take up to 24 hours.

## What Affects Your Quote

Understanding these factors helps you design for cost-effective manufacturing:

### Material Selection

| Material | Best For | Relative Cost |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Aluminum 6061 | General purpose, prototyping | $ |
| Aluminum 7075 | High strength, aerospace | $$ |
| Stainless 304 | Corrosion resistance | $$ |
| Stainless 316 | Marine/chemical environments | $$$ |
| Steel 4140 | Strength, wear resistance | $$ |
| Brass 360 | Electrical, decorative | $$ |
| ABS (3D print) | Functional prototyping | $ |
| PETG (3D print) | Durability, ease of print | $ |
| Resin (SLA) | Fine detail, smooth finish | $$ |

### Geometry Complexity

- **Simple parts** (brackets, plates): Lower cost, faster quotes
- **Moderate complexity** (housings, mounts): Standard pricing
- **Complex geometry** (organic shapes, internal features): Higher setup, longer machine time

### Tolerances

- **Standard tolerances** (±0.005"): No additional cost
- **Tight tolerances** (±0.001"): May require additional operations
- **Very tight tolerances** (±0.0005"): Specialized tooling, higher cost

### Quantity

- **Prototypes (1-10)**: Higher per-part cost, fastest turnaround
- **Low volume (10-100)**: Economies of scale begin
- **Production (100+)**: Significant per-part savings

### Surface Finish

- **As-machined**: Fastest, lowest cost
- **Bead blast**: Uniform matte appearance
- **Anodize**: Corrosion protection, color options
- **Powder coat**: Durable, cosmetic finish

### Robotics Startup: 48-Hour Iteration Cycle

A Seattle robotics company needed to iterate quickly on bracket designs. With our instant quoting:

- **Morning**: Upload new bracket design
- **Midday**: Receive quote, approve production
- **Next day**: Parts in hand, test fit
- **Repeat**: New iteration same day

**Result**: 12 design iterations in 2 weeks vs. 2 iterations with their previous vendor.

### Aerospace Component: From Quote to Delivery in 5 Days

[Player Aerospace](/post/player_announce/) needed propulsion components with tight tolerances:

- **Day 1**: STEP files uploaded, quote received in 3 hours
- **Day 2**: Design review call, minor tolerance adjustment
- **Day 3-4**: Parts machined
- **Day 5**: Parts delivered, inspected, approved

**Result**: Critical path component delivered ahead of schedule.

### Event Venue: Custom Fixtures on Tight Timeline

[C7 Event Venue](/post/c7_event_venue_parts/) needed custom lighting fixtures for a grand opening:

- **Quote**: Received same day
- **Production**: 3-day turnaround
- **Installation**: Completed day before event

**Result**: Opening night went off without a hitch.
