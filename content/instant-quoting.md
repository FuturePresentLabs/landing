## Stop Waiting to Buy Manufacturing Services

When you want to order custom parts from traditional machine shops, you know the frustrating drill:

1. **Email your files** and wait...
2. **Follow up** a day later when you haven't heard back
3. **Answer clarifying questions** about tolerances, materials, quantities
4. **Wait some more** while they manually calculate pricing
5. **Receive an opaque quote** with unclear line items
6. **Start over** when the price doesn't match your budget

**Total time: 3-7 days.** That's a week of project delay before you can even hire a manufacturer and buy your parts.

## Our Instant Pricing Process—Ready to Buy in Hours

<img src="/images/instant-quote/quote-process.png" alt="Streamlined quoting process from upload to quote" class="section-image" style="width: 100%; max-width: min(700px, 95vw); height: auto; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px;">

We've streamlined our manufacturing services to get you pricing fast—so you can buy with confidence:

### 1. Upload Your Files

Send us your CAD files via our [instant quote form](https://quote.fpl.dev), email, or direct file transfer. We accept:

- **STEP** (.step, .stp) — Preferred for CNC machining
- **STL** (.stl) — For 3D printing
- **Parasolid** (.x_t, .x_b) — For complex geometry
- **SolidWorks** (.sldprt, .sldasm) — Native format support
- **Fusion 360** — Direct export compatibility
- **AutoCAD DXF** — For 2D waterjet/laser cutting

Don't have CAD files? Send us a sketch, photo, or detailed description. Our engineers can help translate your concept into manufacturable geometry.

### 2. Automated Design Analysis

Our systems automatically analyze your files for:

- **Manufacturability** — Can this be made with standard processes?
- **Material suggestions** — What alloys or plastics fit your needs?
- **Tolerances** — Are your specifications realistic and cost-effective?
- **Setup complexity** — How many operations are required?
- **Risk factors** — Thin walls, deep pockets, tight tolerances

This automated DFM (Design for Manufacturing) check happens within minutes, not days.

### 3. Transparent Pricing to Buy with Confidence

Receive detailed pricing to buy your parts that breaks down:

- **Material costs** — Based on real-time pricing for the raw stock
- **Machine time** — Accurate hour estimates for CNC machining or 3D printing
- **Setup fees** — One-time per-batch costs to program and fixture your job
- **Post-processing** — Finishing, coating, assembly services
- **Shipping** — Options from economy to overnight delivery

**No hidden fees. No surprises.** The price you see is the price you pay to order your custom parts.

### 4. Human Review (When Needed)

For complex parts or unusual requirements, a human engineer reviews the automated quote to ensure accuracy. This hybrid approach gives you speed without sacrificing precision.

**Most quotes are returned within 2-4 hours during business hours.** Complex assemblies may take up to 24 hours.

## What Affects Your Quote

Understanding these factors helps you design for cost-effective manufacturing:

### Material Selection

| Material | Best For | Relative Cost |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Aluminum 6061 | General purpose, prototyping | $ |
| Aluminum 7075 | High strength, aerospace | $$ |
| Stainless 304 | Corrosion resistance | $$ |
| Stainless 316 | Marine/chemical environments | $$$ |
| Steel 4140 | Strength, wear resistance | $$ |
| Brass 360 | Electrical, decorative | $$ |
| ABS (3D print) | Functional prototyping | $ |
| PETG (3D print) | Durability, ease of print | $ |
| Resin (SLA) | Fine detail, smooth finish | $$ |

### Geometry Complexity

- **Simple parts** (brackets, plates): Lower cost, faster quotes
- **Moderate complexity** (housings, mounts): Standard pricing
- **Complex geometry** (organic shapes, internal features): Higher setup, longer machine time

### Tolerances

- **Standard tolerances** (±0.005"): No additional cost
- **Tight tolerances** (±0.001"): May require additional operations
- **Very tight tolerances** (±0.0005"): Specialized tooling, higher cost

### Quantity

- **Prototypes (1-10)**: Higher per-part cost, fastest turnaround
- **Low volume (10-100)**: Economies of scale begin
- **Production (100+)**: Significant per-part savings

### Surface Finish

- **As-machined**: Fastest, lowest cost
- **Bead blast**: Uniform matte appearance
- **Anodize**: Corrosion protection, color options
- **Powder coat**: Durable, cosmetic finish

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How accurate is your instant pricing to buy parts?**

A: Our automated pricing is typically within 10% of final cost. For complex parts, we may follow up with clarifying questions before you purchase to ensure accurate pricing.

**Q: What if I don't have CAD files to order parts?**

A: No problem when you hire our services. Send us sketches, photos, or detailed descriptions. We can help develop manufacturable designs from your concepts so you can buy with confidence.

**Q: Can you handle production volumes if I want to buy many parts?**

A: Yes. While many customers hire us for prototypes and low-volume orders (1-1,000 pieces), we can scale manufacturing services to higher volumes through our partner network.

**Q: Do you offer design services before I buy?**

A: We provide DFM feedback and minor design optimizations as part of our quoting services. For full design services before you order, we can refer you to our partner network.

**Q: What if the pricing is outside my budget to buy?**

A: We'll work with you to identify cost-reduction opportunities—simplifying geometry, changing materials, adjusting tolerances, or modifying quantities—so you can still purchase your parts.
