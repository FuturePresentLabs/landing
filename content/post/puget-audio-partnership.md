**SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026** — Future Present Labs (FPL), a Seattle-based precision CNC machining and mechatronics consulting firm, today announced the expansion of its manufacturing capabilities to include premium audio equipment production. The company has begun producing precision-machined aluminum enclosures and electronic assemblies for boutique audio manufacturers.

## Precision Manufacturing for Demanding Applications

The expansion into audio equipment manufacturing represents a natural evolution for FPL, leveraging the company's existing expertise in precision machining and electromechanical assembly. Audio equipment presents unique manufacturing challenges that align with FPL's core capabilities:

- **Tight Tolerances**: Potentiometers, switches, and connectors require precise hole patterns and mounting features for reliable operation
- **Enclosure Integrity**: Aluminum enclosures must provide electromagnetic shielding while maintaining structural rigidity for touring durability
- **Surface Quality**: Professional audio products demand flawless surface finishes suitable for anodizing, powder coating, or Cerakote
- **Electronic Integration**: PCB mounting, wiring harnesses, and component installation require clean assembly practices

"Audio equipment manufacturing is an excellent fit for our capabilities," said Avery Wagar, CEO of Future Present Labs. "The combination of precision-machined enclosures with electronic assembly plays to our strengths as a shop that handles both mechanical and electromechanical work."

## Manufacturing Capabilities

Future Present Labs brings the following capabilities to audio equipment manufacturing:

### CNC Machining
- **4-Axis Milling**: Complex enclosure geometries, recessed panels, and integrated features
- **Tight Tolerances**: ±0.001" precision on critical mounting features and hole patterns  
- **Material Selection**: Aluminum 6061-T6 for lightweight enclosures, brass for knobs and hardware
- **Prototyping to Production**: Quick-turn prototypes for design validation, then seamless scaling

### Electronics Assembly
- **PCB Integration**: Mounting and interconnecting circuit boards within machined enclosures
- **Component Installation**: Potentiometers, switches, jacks, and LEDs with proper strain relief
- **Wiring Harnesses**: Custom cable assemblies with professional soldering and termination
- **Testing Protocols**: Continuity testing, functional verification, and burn-in procedures

### Surface Finishing
- **Coordination with Partners**: Anodizing, powder coating, and Cerakote through established local vendors
- **Silkscreen & Laser Marking**: Control labeling, branding, and regulatory markings
- **Quality Inspection**: Surface finish verification before secondary operations

### Rapid Prototyping
- **3D Printing**: FDM and resin printing for fit-check prototypes and design validation
- **Quick-Turn Machining**: First article enclosures in days, not weeks
- **Iterative Development**: Same-day feedback and design modifications

## Pacific Northwest Manufacturing Advantage

Keeping production local provides significant advantages for audio equipment manufacturers:

- **Rapid Iteration**: Design changes can be implemented and tested within days
- **Quality Control**: First article inspection and in-process checks happen in real-time
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: No overseas shipping delays or tariff uncertainties
- **Collaborative Development**: Engineers can visit the shop, inspect parts, and refine designs on-site

"For boutique manufacturers, the ability to walk into the shop and inspect first articles same-day is invaluable," noted Wagar. "That level of collaboration simply isn't possible with overseas manufacturing."
