**SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026** — Puget Audio, a Seattle-based boutique builder of analog FX pedals for guitar and bass, has tapped Future Present Labs to handle manufacturing for their debut product line.

Puget Audio designs handwired analog pedals—no DSP, no modeling, just discrete circuitry and premium components. Their first three pedals cover the essentials: overdrive, fuzz, and analog delay. With designs finalized, they needed a manufacturing partner who could handle everything from enclosure prep to final assembly without sending work overseas.

## Why FPL

Puget Audio specifically wanted a partner who could manage the full stack: DFM feedback on their enclosure designs, machining standard 125B enclosures, sourcing PCBs domestically, assembly, and finishing—all under one roof in Seattle.

FPL will handle DFM and CNC drilling/milling on the 125B enclosures, source bare PCBs from a domestic fab shop, manage component procurement, and handle final assembly including soldering, wiring, and functional testing. Cerakote finishing and laser engraving happen in-house at FPL's facility.

## Timeline

DFM feedback is underway. First articles ship late March. Production ramp begins Q2 2026.
