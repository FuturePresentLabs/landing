**SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026** — Puget Audio has tapped Future Present Labs (FPL) to manufacture precision-machined aluminum enclosures, electronic assemblies, and custom hardware for their upcoming line of professional audio equipment.

The partnership brings together Puget Audio's design expertise with FPL's precision CNC machining and electromechanical assembly capabilities. FPL will serve as the primary manufacturing partner, handling everything from prototype iterations through production runs at their Seattle facility.

## Manufacturing Partnership Highlights

The collaboration leverages FPL's comprehensive manufacturing capabilities to bring Puget Audio's designs to market:

### Precision Enclosure Manufacturing

- **4-Axis CNC Milling**: Complex aluminum enclosure geometries with integrated mounting features, recessed panels, and precision-machined apertures for controls and connectors
- **Tight Tolerances**: ±0.001" precision on critical mounting features to ensure reliable potentiometer, switch, and jack fitment
- **Material Optimization**: 6061-T6 aluminum selection for optimal strength-to-weight ratio and electromagnetic shielding properties
- **Design for Manufacturing**: Collaborative engineering review to optimize enclosure designs for machinability and assembly

### Electronic Assembly Integration

- **PCB Mounting Systems**: Precision-machined standoffs and mounting features for secure circuit board installation
- **Component Integration**: Professional installation of potentiometers, switches, jacks, and indicator LEDs with proper strain relief and cable management
- **Wiring Harnesses**: Custom cable assemblies with professional soldering, termination, and routing
- **Testing Protocols**: Comprehensive continuity testing, functional verification, and quality assurance procedures

### Surface Finishing & Branding

- **Finish Coordination**: Management of anodizing, powder coating, and Cerakote applications through established local partners
- **Precision Marking**: Laser engraving and silkscreen applications for control labeling and brand identification
- **Quality Inspection**: Surface finish verification and dimensional validation before secondary operations

## The Strategic Fit

Puget Audio selected Future Present Labs based on the unique combination of precision machining expertise and electromechanical assembly capabilities required for professional audio equipment manufacturing.

"Professional audio equipment demands both precision-machined enclosures and clean electronic assembly," said Avery Wagar, CEO of Future Present Labs. "Our ability to handle both the mechanical and electromechanical aspects of production makes us an ideal manufacturing partner for companies like Puget Audio."

## Local Manufacturing Advantages

The Pacific Northwest-based partnership provides significant advantages over traditional offshore manufacturing:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Design iterations can be implemented and validated within days rather than weeks
- **Real-Time Quality Control**: First article inspection and in-process verification happen on-site with immediate feedback
- **Engineering Collaboration**: Design teams can visit the facility, inspect parts, and refine designs in real-time
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: Elimination of overseas shipping delays and tariff uncertainties
- **IP Protection**: Sensitive designs and proprietary technology remain within U.S. jurisdiction

## About Future Present Labs

Future Present Labs is a Seattle-based CNC machining and mechatronics consulting firm founded in 2018. Operating from its Ballard facility, FPL maintains 4-axis CNC milling capabilities, CNC turning, 3D printing, and electronics assembly operations. The company serves clients across aerospace, defense, consumer electronics, and professional audio industries, specializing in rapid prototyping, precision manufacturing, and integrated electromechanical solutions.

## About the Partnership

The manufacturing partnership represents a strategic alignment between two Pacific Northwest-based companies committed to local production and precision manufacturing. FPL's capabilities enable Puget Audio to maintain design flexibility, rapid iteration cycles, and quality control throughout the product development process.

Production is scheduled to commence in Q2 2026, with initial product availability expected shortly thereafter.
