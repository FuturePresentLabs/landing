**SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026** — Puget Audio has tapped Future Present Labs (FPL) to manufacture their upcoming line of analog FX pedals. FPL will handle DFM feedback, CNC-machined enclosures, PCB sourcing and integration, final assembly, and finishing.

## What FPL Is Handling

**Design for Manufacturing**

Working from Puget Audio's initial enclosure designs, FPL is providing DFM feedback to optimize for machining: wall thickness for tool access, internal corner radii, thread depth for potentiometer mounting, and datum selection for consistent setup across prototype and production runs.

**CNC Enclosures**

- 6061-T6 aluminum, 0.125" wall thickness
- 4-axis work to hit all mounting bosses and jack holes in one setup
- Tight tolerance on potentiometer holes (±0.002") for clean fits
- Pocketing for 9V battery compartment and PCB clearance

**PCB Sourcing & Integration**

FPL is sourcing bare PCBs from a domestic fab shop and managing component procurement. PCB mounting uses machined standoffs with self-tapping screws. Wiring harnesses are custom-cut and terminated in-house.

**Final Assembly**

- Potentiometers, jacks, and footswitch installation
- LED wiring with proper strain relief
- 9V clip integration
- Full continuity and functional testing before shipping

**Finishing**

Enclosures go out for Cerakote (black and clear options), then return for laser engraving of control labels and the Puget logo. Knobs are sourced separately and pressed on during final assembly.

## Timeline

DFM feedback is underway. First article enclosures are scheduled for late March. Production ramp begins Q2 2026.
