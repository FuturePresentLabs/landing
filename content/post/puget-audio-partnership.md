**SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026** — Puget Audio has tapped Future Present Labs (FPL) to manufacture their upcoming line of analog FX pedals. FPL will handle DFM, CNC drilling and milling on standard 125B enclosures, PCB integration, final assembly, and in-house Cerakote finishing.

## What FPL Is Handling

**DFM & Machining**

Working from Puget Audio's designs, FPL is providing DFM feedback and machining standard 125B aluminum enclosures: drilling for pots, jacks, and footswitch, plus any pocketing needed for battery clearance.

**PCB Integration & Assembly**

FPL is sourcing bare PCBs domestically and managing component procurement. Final assembly includes soldering, wiring, and full functional testing.

**Finishing**

Cerakote is applied in-house at FPL's Seattle facility, followed by laser engraving of control labels. Knobs are sourced separately and installed during final assembly.

## Timeline

DFM feedback is underway. First articles ship late March. Production ramp begins Q2 2026.
