**SEATTLE, WA – November 15, 2025** – Future Present Labs has begun fabricating custom components for C7, a Seattle event venue undergoing ongoing interior updates.

The current scope includes custom light fixture housings, machined metal keepsakes, and architectural shrouds designed to conceal reconfigured equipment mounting points while maintaining the venue's aesthetic.

"Event spaces need hardware that looks intentional but can take a beating," said Avery Wagar, CEO of Future Present Labs. "We're working directly with C7's team to prototype and produce pieces that fit their operational reality—quick turnarounds, field-adjustable designs, and finishes that don't look like afterthoughts."

FPL's approach combines CNC machining with rapid prototyping, allowing venue operators to test components in place before committing to larger production runs.

The collaboration reflects FPL's expansion into hospitality and entertainment manufacturing, where custom mechanical solutions often require both aesthetic consideration and operational durability.
