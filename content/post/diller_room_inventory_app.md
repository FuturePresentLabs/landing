*Future Present Labs is pairing software and shop-floor awareness to keep one of Seattle’s busiest cocktail bars on top of every bottle, garnish, and CO2 swap.*

**SEATTLE, WA – August 10, 2025** – The Diller Room has partnered with Future Present Labs (FPL) to replace their manual inventory process with a purpose-built tablet app. The project connects the bar’s back-of-house counts, real-time supplier pricing, and automated reorder nudges so bartenders can focus on service instead of spreadsheets.

FPL is architecting the entire stack—from lightweight barcode scanning hardware to the cloud dashboard that alerts managers before a curated bottle runs dry. The custom workflow factors in par levels, aging cocktails, and limited releases that require coordinated pickups downtown.

“This is what happens when you partner with engineers who actually spend time in your space,” said The Diller Room’s ownership team. “FPL listened to our quirks, like batching syrups and rotating menus weekly, and turned it into software that feels handcrafted.”

Full case study coming soon as the app rolls out across the bar’s day and night shifts.
