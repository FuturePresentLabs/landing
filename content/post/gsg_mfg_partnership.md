*Future Present Labs is now supporting GSG Manufacturing with rapid machining, fixture design, and engineering support for their expanding line of firearm accessories.*

**SEATTLE, WA – August 12, 2025** – GSG Manufacturing selected Future Present Labs (FPL) to help compress the build-test-ship cycle for accessory rails, charging handles, and specialty fixtures. The program combines FPL’s in-house CNC capability with firmware, test, and traceability tooling so GSG can iterate confidently without slowing sales.

The collaboration focuses on three pillars:

1. **High-mix machining:** Lightweight fixtures and modular vice jaws allow FPL to flip between accessory SKUs without sacrificing tolerance control.
2. **Secure prototyping:** Encrypted file transfer and isolated workholding storage align with the confidentiality requirements around firearm-adjacent work.
3. **Integrated QA tooling:** Custom torque, load, and cycle-test rigs generate clean data sooner, reducing the number of lots GSG keeps in quarantine.

“FPL has the rare combo of machinists, embedded folks, and software engineers in one shop,” said the GSG Manufacturing team. “They spot downstream risks early and give us a clearer path to release hardware.”

More details will be published as the first accessory runs ship to customers later this quarter.
