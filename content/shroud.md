### Why Shroud? Immediate Benefits for Your Enterprise.

#### **Drastically Reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
Maximize your hardware investment. Shroud's ultra-low overhead allows you to pack significantly more workloads onto each server, driving down infrastructure costs and boosting operational efficiency. No more paying for bloated layers of abstraction or cloud vendor lock-in.

#### **Uncompromised Security & Air-Gapped Ready**
Built for environments demanding the highest levels of control and compliance. Shroud offers strong microVM isolation, a minimalist attack surface, and the ability to operate seamlessly in air-gapped networks. All essential dependencies are vendorable, ensuring supply chain integrity and simplifying FIPS compliance.

#### **Blazing Speed & Unrivaled Performance**
Experience near-instant microVM boot times (sub-100ms guest kernel to user-space). This responsiveness is ideal for latency-sensitive applications, bursty computations, event-driven automation, and the demanding needs of next-generation agentic AI workloads. Shroud puts your compute power directly at your fingertips, without the cloud's inherent latency.

#### **Radical Simplicity for Streamlined Operations**
Navigate infrastructure management with ease. Shroud's intuitive CLI and lean Rust daemon simplify complex orchestration tasks, reducing the operational burden on your teams. Focus on deploying your applications, not managing the infrastructure complexity.
