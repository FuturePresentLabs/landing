        <article>
            <p><strong>SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026</strong> — Future Present Labs (FPL), a Seattle-based precision CNC machining and mechatronics consulting firm, today announced a strategic manufacturing partnership with <a href="https://puget.audio">Puget Audio</a>, an emerging boutique audio equipment manufacturer specializing in analog FX pedals for guitar and bass.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, FPL will serve as the primary manufacturing partner for Puget Audio&rsquo;s debut pedal line, which includes three flagship products: The Overdrive ($149), The Fuzz ($129), and The Delay ($179). The pedals feature handwired analog circuitry with premium components, true bypass switching, and rugged enclosures built to withstand the demands of touring musicians.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-capabilities-for-premium-audio-hardware">The Right Capabilities for Premium Audio Hardware</h2>
<p>Puget Audio selected Future Present Labs based on FPL&rsquo;s unique combination of precision machining capabilities and electronics manufacturing expertise—critical requirements for producing high-quality FX pedals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needed a partner who could deliver precision-machined aluminum enclosures with tight tolerances while understanding the nuances of electronic assembly,&rdquo; said Avery Wagar, CEO of Future Present Labs. &ldquo;Our 4-axis CNC milling capabilities and experience with electromechanical assemblies make us an ideal fit for Puget Audio&rsquo;s manufacturing needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Future Present Labs brings the following capabilities to the partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4-Axis CNC Milling</strong>: Precision-machined aluminum enclosures with ±0.001&quot; tolerances for perfect potentiometer, switch, and connector fitment</li>
<li><strong>CNC Turning</strong>: Precision-machined knobs, collars, and hardware in aluminum, brass, and stainless steel</li>
<li><strong>Electronics Assembly</strong>: Integration of PCBs, potentiometers, switches, and jacks into finished pedal assemblies</li>
<li><strong>Surface Finishing Coordination</strong>: Cerakote, anodizing, and powder coating through established local partners</li>
<li><strong>Silkscreen &amp; Laser Engraving</strong>: Professional branding and control labeling directly on enclosures</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong>: 3D printing and quick-turn machining for iterative design validation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-pedal-line">About the Pedal Line</h2>
<p>Puget Audio&rsquo;s debut lineup targets professional and serious amateur musicians seeking authentic analog tone:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Overdrive</strong> ($149): Classic tube screamer warmth with expanded gain range, true bypass, limited first run</li>
<li><strong>The Fuzz</strong> ($129): Germanium transistor fuzz with bias control, from mild crunch to velcro rippage</li>
<li><strong>The Delay</strong> ($179): Analog bucket-brigade delay with modulation, 600ms of warm repeats</li>
</ul>
<p>All three pedals feature handwired analog signal paths with no digital modeling or emulation—pure circuitry for pure tone.</p>
<h2 id="pacific-northwest-manufacturing">Pacific Northwest Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Both companies are committed to keeping production local. Puget Audio designs and prototypes in Seattle, while Future Present Labs handles manufacturing in their Ballard shop—ensuring tight quality control, rapid iteration, and reduced environmental impact from overseas shipping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working with a local manufacturer means we can walk into the shop, inspect first articles, and make adjustments same-day,&rdquo; said the Puget Audio team. &ldquo;That level of collaboration is impossible with overseas manufacturing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<p>The Overdrive is scheduled for initial release in Q2 2026, with The Fuzz and The Delay following later in the year. Musicians interested in early access can join the waitlist at <a href="https://puget.audio">puget.audio</a> for a 20% discount on the first production run.</p>
