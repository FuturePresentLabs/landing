      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEATTLE, WA — February 16, 2026&lt;/strong&gt; — Puget Audio, a Seattle-based boutique builder of analog FX pedals for guitar and bass, has tapped Future Present Labs to handle manufacturing for their debut product line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Puget Audio designs handwired analog pedals—no DSP, no modeling, just discrete circuitry and premium components. Their first three pedals cover the essentials: overdrive, fuzz, and analog delay. With designs finalized, they needed a manufacturing partner who could handle everything from enclosure prep to final assembly without sending work overseas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
