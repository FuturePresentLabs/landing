      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEATTLE, WA – November 15, 2025&lt;/strong&gt; – Future Present Labs has begun fabricating custom components for C7 Belevue, a luxury Bellevue event space undergoing ongoing interior updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current scope includes custom light fixture housings, machined metal keepsakes, and architectural shrouds designed to conceal reconfigured equipment mounting points while maintaining the venue&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Event spaces need hardware that looks intentional but can take a beating,&amp;rdquo; said Avery Wagar, CEO of Future Present Labs. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re working directly with C7&amp;rsquo;s team to prototype and produce pieces that fit their operational reality—quick turnarounds, field-adjustable designs, and finishes that don&amp;rsquo;t look like afterthoughts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
